# Bober IE-Reference
An in-ear monitor target based on the JM-1 or PopAvg-DF HRTF. The main goal here is to maintain the tonal character of a flat on-axis measuring speakers in a nearfield acoustic load then translating that into IEMs.

The low shelf boost at 60 Hz (+10 dB, Q = 0.5) compensates for bass roll off in a gradual, natural lift rather than the usual steeper shelf to prevent boominess and help achieve a more natural bass response, and the high shelf cut at 2500 Hz (-2.5 dB, Q = 0.4) helps bring down the treble into a more realistic level compared to the untilted JM-1 target.
