# Bober IE-Reference
An in-ear monitor target based on the JM-1 or PopAvg-DF HRTF. The main goal here is to maintain the tonal character of a flat on-axis measuring speakers in a nearfield acoustic load then translating that into IEMs.

This target was achieved by adding a 10 dB low shelf at 60 Hz with Q factor of 0.5 and a -2.5 dB high shelf at 2500 Hz with Q factor of 0.4 over untilted JM-1.
